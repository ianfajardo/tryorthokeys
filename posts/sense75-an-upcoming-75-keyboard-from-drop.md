## What is the SENSE75 Keyboard?

![SENSE75 Keyboard](/sense75-drop-keyboard.jpg "SENSE75 Keyboard")

The SENSE75 Keyboard is the newest keyboard edition from the [Drop](https://drop.com/?referer=T93XGG) along with the Drop ALT, CTRL, and ENTR. The keyboard is created with CNC-machined, aircraft-grade aluminum; bundled with their new DCX profile keycaps, Holy Panda X switches, and their own phantom stabilizers. It's truly a keyboard created with all of DROP's best products in one. The design is very minimal with only two colors: a "Nightfall" all black design and a white version with a "white electrophoretic coating". The white version looks especially sleek with a color matched rotary knob. 

Speaking of rotary knobs, the knob on the keyboard is aluminum with mountain knurling. This mountain knurling texture give the knob a great grip to allow for minimal force when turning. The knob isn't a free spinning-knob and on each turn, clicks due to the premium alps encoder. 

The gasket features on the keyboard are completely custom too. Drop describes trying to reach a middle ground between not being too stiff and not too mushy.

> When pressing a key on a gasket keyboard, the ideal result is that after the switch bottoms out, the gaskets (and plate) continue to allow for travel, thus providing a softer conclusion of the keystroke (and a quieter sound!).

## How much is the SENSE75 and when will it launch?

**SENSE75 will be launching on 8/30 at 9am PT for $349 fully-assembled with Phantom Stabilizers, Holy Panda X switches and DCX keycaps.**

Additionally, the first 500 purchasers will receive the following bonuses for their early support: 

* Free MT3 keycap set (note that this will require the use of a coupon, and will therefore conflict with your monthly DKC coupon; Drop rewards can be used with purchase)
* Free novelty keycap celebrating the launch of the SENSE75
* Free keyboard carrying case

The first 500 keyboards will ship in November.

Drop is also planning on  working on launching a number of mod options as well, such as weight plates, polycarbonate- and carbon fiber internal plates etc, which all are expected to be available once the SENSE75 ships.
