## **Shared Characteristics**

One of the first things to note about Akko's newest switches is their factory lube. Unlike many switches on the market, which may require additional lubrication for optimal performance, Akko's switches come perfectly lubed straight from the factory. This not only saves enthusiasts time and effort but also ensures consistent performance out of the box.

## **Sound Signature**

If you're a fan of the classic "clack" sound, Akko switches won't disappoint. They tend to lean towards the louder and brighter end of the spectrum, offering a satisfying auditory experience with every keystroke.

## **Pricing and Packaging**

Perhaps the most enticing aspect of Akko's switches is their affordability. With prices ranging from 20 to 33 cents per switch, they offer exceptional value for money. 

## **Cream Yellow, Blue, and Black**
