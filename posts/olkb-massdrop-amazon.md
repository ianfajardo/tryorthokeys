## Why purchase a OLKB Planck & Preonic?

The OLKB Planck & Preonic are the pioneers of Ortholinear keyboards and a staple in the community.  There are both programmable via the [QMK firmware](/configure) and the owner of OLKB, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jackhumbert">Jack Humbert</a>, is also the founder of QMK.  Being the most popular ortholinear keyboard, there are a lot of information and tutorials on keymaps online and a great community for support on any mods on your board.  You can fully customize your key mappings and can even play music since the Planck & Preonic contain speakers!

With the smaller form factor on ortholinear keyboards, your fingers aren't more than two keys away from what is considered home row on most key keyboards. They are a favorite for those who want to carry their keyboard on the go.

### Planck

The latest version of the Planck keyboard supports hot swappable switches, LEDs, a small speaker and even rotary encoders. There are several offerings for baseplates: EOTW (easy on the wallet), hi-pro and low-pro. These keyboards usually come in as a kit with some light assembly required.
