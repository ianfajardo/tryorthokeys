## Tactile Switches and What They Do

If you've been in the mechanical keyboard world for any length of time, you've probably come across different kinds of mechanical switches. A tactile switch is one that uses a "tactile" bump feel to indicate when the key has been pressed. The bump also tells you that the key has been pressed and released, as opposed to a clicky switch which will only have an audible sound. The other type of switch is a linear switch, which has no bump and has a smooth keystroke throughout the press. If you've been in the mechanical keyboard world for any length of time, you've probably come across different kinds of mechanical switches.

The most common entry-level tactile switch is the [Cherry MX Brown](https://amzn.to/3J5boVN). These are a solid way to get introduced to this style of switch, but there are plenty more with different weights and feels. Well, we’ve scoured the internet and read tons of reviews to find the top 5 best tactile switches on the market today taking into account popularity, price, feel, and availability.

### Cherry MX Clear

If you're a beginner enthusiast and don't want to spend too much money or stray too far away from your Cherry MX Browns, the MX Clears are your next solid best bet.

### Halo Clears and Trues

Both of these switches are from the DROP brand and are great starter tactile switches. Each has a medium to heavy switch feel and a relatively heavy spring to discourage bottoming out. These switches are in the mid-range price on this list and are recommended for those who want to step up their tactile game but don't want to completely break the bank. These have a slightly bigger bump than the MX Browns/Clears but are not as tactile as the others on the list. If we were to choose one over the other, we like the Halo Clears a tad bit more than the Trues. The bottoming out force of the Trues can be a bit much.

**Trues:**

- 60g Actuation
- 1.9mm actuation point and 4mm total travel
- 100g bottom out

**Clears:**

- 65g Actuation
- 1.9mm actuation point and 4mm total travel
- 78g bottom out

### Holy Pandas

The "Holy Grail" of tactile switches, these are the most popular and well-known switches on the list. They are easily the most expensive on the list but can be well worth the price.

### Zealios

Zealios are another fan favorite from Zeal PC, along with Holy Pandas. They offer a plethora of different weighted switches, unlike the other options on the list, so you can really tweak how you want your keyboard to feel. These have a noticeable tactile bump and are slightly more tactile than the holy pandas. If you're looking for something more tactile, these might be your best bet.

- Translucent housing
