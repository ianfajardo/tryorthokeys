## Introduction: What is the ID75?

<p class="lead">The ID75 is a 75-key keyboard, larger than most standard, ortholinear keyboards. </p>

In addition to the alpha keys and standard modifiers on an ortho keyboard like the Planck, there are extra function keys in the middle. This is a great alternative if you want extra programmable keys, as opposed to the 48 keys on the OLKB Planck and 60 keys on the OLKB Preonic.

## Features of the ID75

**Technical Specifications**

- Hot-swappable PCB
- USB-C
- CNC-milled, anodized aluminum case: Black, Blue, Silver, Black-Blue, and Purple
- Customizable via QMK and VIA
- Acrylic LED Shine-Through and Underglow

The [ID75](https://amzn.to/3BLxtWs) has a hotswappable PCB, connects via USB Type C, and has a CNC-milled anodized aluminum case with several color options. The board is customizable using QMK or VIA just like the OLKB Planck and Preonic. To customize your keyboard, you can use different layers or programs to create shortcuts to different functions.

Customizing your keyboard typically requires using a layer- or program-based system to create shortcuts to different functions. Layer-based systems allow you to create "layers" for your keyboard, assigning each layer a series of keys that can trigger commands.

With the 75-key layout, the default keymap has the keyboard working almost like a split keyboard with extra function keys in the middle. A common layout features a num pad in the middle for those that have need for one.

There are many benefits of an ortholinear keyboard that the ID75 shares with all the others. If you want something portable to carry back and forth between work and home or travel with on business trips, this is a great option.

## Why the ID75 keyboard might be right for you

Although not as compact as the Planck keyboard, the ID75 is still much smaller than your standard TKL keyboard. There are many people that would like to use an ortholinear keyboard and a number pad for data-entry and tasks that require a lot of typing in numbers. If that is you, then the ID75 will be perfect. The ID75 has a hot-swappable PCB which lets you easily swap out its mechanical switches.
