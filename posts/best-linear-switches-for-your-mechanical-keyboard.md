## Top Three Best Linear Switches

There are many linear switches to choose from, but we narrowed them down to the top three. Here are some desired traits for linear switches that factored into our decision: smoothness, sound, and actuation force.

Linear switches are great for gaming, quieter for the office, and buttery smooth. Compared to clicky and tactile switches, there is no percievable bump for initial actuation. Linears are great switches for those that need precision and speed when typing. If you also value smoothness and a quieter sound compared to clicky and tactile switches these are so for you. Below are our recommendations for the best swtiches to pick up for your next linear switch build.

### Gateron Yellow

The Gateron Yellow switches are a favorite among enthusiasts because they come at a great price and provide a super-smooth typing experience. These are highly recommended throughout the internet over some of the more expensive switches out there. For any beginner out there looking for better switches than Gateron Reds, this is the place to start and you won't be disappointed.

**Specs:**

- 50g Actuation
- 5-pin PCB Mount
- 4mm Travel

### Gateron Ink Black V2

Another Gateron offering, the Ink Black V2's are a bit more expensive than the yellows but offer an even smoother experience. They're also a slightly heavier switch for those who prefer it. The Ink Blacks, in our opinion, feel a lot better than the stock Gateron Yellows, but both should be lubricated for a better experience. If you're looking for a more "premium" feel, definitely go for the Gateron Ink BLack V2.

**Specs:**

- 60g operating force (70g bottom)
- 5-pin PCB Mount
- 4mm total-travel
- Smokey Translucent housing

### Novelkey Cream

Known for its great low-bass sound, the Novelkey Cream switches are made of a self-lubricating POM for a unique typing experience. They're a bit scratchy stock, but should definitely be lubed to bring out their best qualities. In terms of weight, these are between the two switches above, with the actuation of the Gateron yellows and the bottoming out of the Gateron Ink Blacks.

**Specs:**

- 55g Actuation (70g bottom out)
- 4mm Travel
- Made of POM
- Made of self lubricating POM
