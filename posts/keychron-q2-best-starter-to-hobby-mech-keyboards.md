### Mechancial keyboards Are Way Better Than Membrane Keyboards

Membrane keyboards use cheaper plastic parts and can't offer the same quality as a mechanical keyboard. Mechanical keyboards have a longer lifespan and a more responsive feel than membrane keyboards. Although membrane keyboards are the cheapest way to get into mechanical keyboards, they don't have good key switches. They use rubber dome switches, which don't feel as good compared to real mechanical switches.

## What can You Do with a Programmable Keyboard?

Programmable keyboards are a great way to make your work easier, more efficient, and more accurate. They allow you to automate repetitive tasks and increase your productivity. You can use either QMK or VIA editors which are both free and open-source to create macros and update your keyboard layout. With support for bothm, you can program and remap each key to whatever you heart designs. You can also change backlighting effects and more using the same application.

Programmable keyboards can be programmed with macros or shortcuts that can be used in any app or software. These shortcuts are called "hotkeys" and they allow you to create keyboard combinations that will perform a specific task - for example, saving a file on your computer.
