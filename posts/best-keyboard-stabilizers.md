## What is a Keyboard Stabilizer?

A keyboard stabilizer is placed beneath the bigger keys on your keyboard to allow for an even press through and to prevent any rattling or unevenness. They keep your keycaps stable when pressed down with the switch so that you have a consistent typing experience and a pleasing sound. There are different types of stabilizers based off your keyboard PCB and compatibility. Cherry style stabilizers are by far the widely used out there and these include plate-mounted, screw-in and snap-in options.

### What are the Benefits of Using a Keyboard Stabilizer?

The ideal stabilizer allows for no wobble and minimal sound when those keys are pressed at any angle or area. On a standard keyboard, the keys that need a stabilizer are the spacebar, shift keys, enter/return, and backspace. Having a stable and consistent keypress is important when typing and gaming. For sound, it is a must-have as a noisy and rattly spacebar can be grating to the ears.
