## Upcoming Ortholinear Keyboard: KBDFans Solar Keyboard Kit

From the creators of long out of stock NIU Mini, KBDFans has an interest check on a new and improved ortholinear keyboard: [The Solar Keyboard kit](https://kbdfans.com/r?id=be1aik).

There is little information other than an interest check page with a small list of possible specifications:

- Ortholinear layout, 50 Keys
- PCB: Hotswapable, 1.2 mm thickness, QMK firmware, USB-C interface, without RGB
- Case: Aluminum Top and Bottom, PVD Stainless steel weight
- Structure: Gasket Mount
- 5 degree typing angle
- Replaceable modules: O-LED module, RGB module
- Programmable with 4 knobs
- MX-type switches

The most intriging part of the specs are the gasket mount, replaceable modules, and 4 programmable knobs. You can gleam from the rendered images on the site that there are some readable modules on the corner of the keyboard to display some sort of information along with 4 knobs on the other side of the keyboard. So far the [Work Louder Creator Board](/worklouder) is the most customizable board on the market right now and the new [Solar Kit](https://kbdfans.com/r?id=be1aik) could be another option depending on it's future price point.

## Replacement of the NIU 40 Mini

The [NIU 40 Mini](/niu40) was KBDFans' 40% ortholinear competitor to the OLKB Planck and Preonic. The NIU Mini has been out of stock for a while. They recently came back with B-stock PCBs and cases and promptly sold out of those as well. The price of the NIU was relatively slightly cheaper than the Planck and Preonic and a direct competitor. It looks like this new Solar Keyboard Kit could be it's spiritual sucessor if interest check proves successful and goes into production.

### Planck

The latest version of the Planck keyboard supports hot swappable switches, LEDs, a small speaker and even rotary encoders. There are several offerings for baseplates: EOTW (easy on the wallet), hi-pro and low-pro. These keyboards usually come in as a kit with some light assembly required.

### Preonic

The Preonic keyboard is the Planck's big brother with an extra row of keys for those really missing the number row or want more keys to customize. The newest version of the Preonic is almost identical the Planck in terms of features.
