## Keebmonkey Keyboard Wireless Display Box

The latest keyboard cases are sleek and modern, designed with a slim profile that compliments any desktop setup or shelf. The case comes with an optional single keyboard stand if you already have a stand handy. They have a durable acrylic construction that will hold up against bumps, drops and scrapes with ease. The coolest feature is the wireless LED battery-powered system, that auto-illuminates when someone walks up to it. The motion-sensor saves battery and lasts up to 180 days!

Drop also offers the Keebmonkey keyboard stand without the case in two versions: single and triple. While the single one looks like the same one that comes with the case, the triple stand can hold up to three keyboards to show off!
