For years, the **Planck** and **Preonic** from OLKB have been the go-to 40% ortholinear keyboards. But with their frequent stock shortages, many in the community have been searching for a worthy alternative. Enter the **[YMDK Air40](https://ymdkey.com/products/air40-rgb-hot-swap-cute-40-mechanical-keyboard-assembled-qmk-via-type-c-pcb-cnc-case-plate-kit?_pos=6&_sid=2612e6c36&_ss=r&sca_ref=3163375.1C4wKHXQtf)** â€” a compact, ortholinear aluminum kit thatâ€™s quickly becoming the new standard for anyone wanting to dive into the world of 40% keyboards.

## Why the Air40 Stands Out

The [Air40](https://ymdkey.com/products/air40-rgb-hot-swap-cute-40-mechanical-keyboard-assembled-qmk-via-type-c-pcb-cnc-case-plate-kit?_pos=6&_sid=2612e6c36&_ss=r&sca_ref=3163375.1C4wKHXQtf) takes the best aspects of the 40% form factor â€” compact size, efficient typing, and ortholinear layout â€” and packages it into a premium, customizable kit. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s such a strong contender right now:  

* **Premium CNC Aluminum Case** â€“ The anodized aluminum housing gives the Air40 a solid, high-end feel compared to cheaper plastic kits.  
* **Hot-Swap PCB with VIA Support** â€“ North-facing RGB backlight, underglow options, and full VIA compatibility make customizing your layout and lighting easy without extra software headaches.  
* **No Stabilizers Required** â€“ Inspired by YMDKâ€™s numpad design, the Air40 skips stabilizers entirely. Larger 2u keys feel smooth and relaxed to press, though if youâ€™re picky about perfect stability, itâ€™s worth noting this trade-off.  
* **Flexible Layout Options** â€“ With soldering skills, you can experiment with alternate layouts; otherwise, you can order the pre-set layout of your choice.  
* **True 40% Size** â€“ At just 235mm x 84mm, it embodies the portability and minimalism that make small boards so appealing.

## Add-Ons and Customization Options

One of the biggest advantages of the [Air40](https://ymdkey.com/products/air40-rgb-hot-swap-cute-40-mechanical-keyboard-assembled-qmk-via-type-c-pcb-cnc-case-plate-kit?_pos=6&_sid=2612e6c36&_ss=r&sca_ref=3163375.1C4wKHXQtf) over OLKBâ€™s offerings is the sheer variety of **readily available upgrades and accessories**. YMDK has built an ecosystem around this board that makes it easy to personalize your setup:  

* **Keyboard Foam** â€“ Add dampening foam for a quieter, more refined typing sound. [Get it here Â»](https://ymdkey.com/products/ymd-40-air40-foam?_pos=1&_sid=2612e6c36&_ss=r&sca_ref=3163375.1C4wKHXQtf)
