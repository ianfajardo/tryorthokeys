## Why You Should Care About Swapping Out Your Cherry Red Switches

If you're still using the same old Cherry Red switches on your keyboard, it's time to swap them out. These switches are outdated and they don't provide the same feedback as some of the newer switches. There are actually way more switches out there that provide a better experience than the stock red switches in your current gaming keyboard. 

Depending on your keyboard, you may actually be able to swap them out without having to buy a new one. Hot-swappable keyboards provide the ability to swap switches quickly without having to desolder them directly form the board. Itâ€™s a simple as using a switch pulling tool to remove the switches and pressing in the new switch.

## How do you know if your keyboard has hot-swappable switches

As of recently, it's becoming more and more common for keyboards to have hot-swappable switches.If you're unsure if your keyboard has hot-swappable switches, check the spec sheet or contact the manufacturer. If you want your keyboard to feel better, you can easily swap out the key switches to suit your needs. This will significantly enhance your typing experience and make it more pleasant. You can also customise the weight or sound of a keyboard with hot-swappable switches. If you look up the specifications of your keyboard, you can see if it has hot-swappable key switches. 

If you find that you don't have a keyboard with hot-swappable switches, you won't be able to easily change your stock switches on your keyboard to new ones. It can be advantageous to invest in a hot-swappable keyboard if you feel like you might want to try out different switches in the future. Here are three hot-swappable keyboards that work great and will last you a long time.
