Chances are you've seen this ortholinear keyboard from Work Louder all over Instagram and TikTok. The [Creator Board](/worklouder) is an innovative modular design keyboard that can be configured to suit individual preferences. This is a customizable keyboard (customizable in terms of keys, orientation, modules, and size), which means you can create a personally tailored setup to fit your needs. Additional modules can be added with more customizable knobs and keys. There are currently only two modules, the Loop Pad and the Nano Pad, but additional modules are planned for the future.

Features:

- Cusomizable removable modules
- Up to 6 rotary knobs
- 236 programmable keys across 4 key layers
- VIA and QMK configurarable to customize all keys
- 60% layout

## Great Design and Modularity

It is immediately apparent that the Creator Board was designed for and by designers. Like other ortholinear keyboards, the alpha keyboard itself has the standard 40% layout with 48 keys. However, the ability to add and remove modules is a game-changer. Each of the different modules acts like its own keyboard. Even the underglow and keycap lighting are seperately customizable under the Loop Pad, Nano Pad, and Alpha Keys. You can customize each module for what you want it tailored to, whether its for Photoshop, Twitch, or another program.

Even the packaging that the keyboard came in was impressive.

## Included Keycaps and Switches

If you choose to get a ready-to-use kit, it comes with Kailh choc low-profile switches and their own "wrk." keycaps that align with their design language. They do the job, but they might not be for everyone. The Kailh choc dark yellow switches are fairly heavy linear switches and aren't MX compatible, and the low-profile keycaps aren't the most ergonomic or comfortable to type on.

If they're not your thing or you'd rather add your own keycaps and switches, then you should choose the DIY option. You'll have to solder your own switches since they don't offer a hot-swap option.

## If you're a creator, you should get this keyboard

The Creator Board is perfect for you if you need modularity and customizability. Like its name, it's specifically made for creators, designers, and content creators and it does it amazingly. Compared to other keyboards, the price tag is a lot higher than others. But what you're paying for is customizability and a company that cares about design. More modules are planned, the creators are proactive with the community. Recently, there has been a contest in the community to design a mousepad to sell in their store.

Even if you already have a keyboard you like, Work Louder is working on a micropad called the Creator Micro that has a similar design. They are a fairly new company in the game, but they are already shaking things up in the ortholinear game. You can expect great products coming from this company in the future.

If you're a photographer, video editor or video game designer, the Creator Board can help you make creating easier with its efficient workflow. It's an all-in-one package and you don't need to have more than one keypad. It's portable and compact, perfect for editing on the go.
