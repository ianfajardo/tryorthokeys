## What is Drop Keyclub?

Drop recently announced the [Drop Keycap Club (DKC)](https://drop.com/keycapclub?referer=T93XGG) with a paid annual program with monthly coupons and discounts on keycap purchases. Drop has been a staple in the keyboard community with a variety of limited time mechanical keyboards, keycaps, accessories and more. In addition, they have regularly stocked items that are available including a couple keycap sets.

## What's in the membership?

Per their [keyclub webpage](https://drop.com/keycapclub?referer=T93XGG), the DKC is an annual membership program that is **$69 a year**. It says that the program will offer monthly discounts between **$20 to $100** for members to use on any keycap purchase. It also mentions that these discounts can be used on any **_eligble orders over $100_**. It is important to note that exact amount per month is only a range and no specifics are included on when you get the discounts or how much you get in that yearlong period.

Here some additional perks included with the membership:

- Members will be automatically enrolled in a monthly draw on rare and unique artisan novelty keycaps
- Exclusive access to product launches
- Drop Keycap Community badge on their profile avatar
- Opportunity to become early-reviewers for unreleased keycap sets and other products on Drop

## How much will you save?

The Drop Keycap club seems to be a pretty good deal if you buy keycaps pretty often. With the $70 monthy fee, if you get an average of $60 (between $20 to $100) a month, they you'll be saving almost $650 total a year.

The caveat is the discount could be different each month and you'll have to spend that on a $100+ keycap set every month for the whole year to take advantage of the savings.

If you buy a ~$100 keycap set every month for a year for $1200 plus the $70 original fee with a savings an average of $650, you'll roughly spend $620 a year plus the extra benefits outlined above. That's roughly **52% off!**

It seems like a good deal if you actually want 12 keycap sets a month. Remember, however, that the details on these coupons aren't completely clear yet. In any case, for hardcore enthusiasts, it seems like something to look into.

Use discount code **JOINTHECLUB** to get **$49** for the first year. [Click here learn more!](https://drop.com/keycapclub?referer=T93XGG)

### Planck

The latest version of the Planck keyboard supports hot swappable switches, LEDs, a small speaker and even rotary encoders. There are several offerings for baseplates: EOTW (easy on the wallet), hi-pro and low-pro. These keyboards usually come in as a kit with some light assembly required.

### Preonic

The Preonic keyboard is the Planck's big brother with an extra row of keys for those really missing the number row or want more keys to customize. The newest version of the Preonic is almost identical the Planck in terms of features.
