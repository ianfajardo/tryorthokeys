## How the OLKB Planck and Preonic Mechanical Keyboard is Perfect For Your iPad Pro

The OLKB [Planck](https://amzn.to/333pMu0) and [Preonic](https://amzn.to/3xzTDbF) Mechanical Keyboard is the perfect companion for your iPad Pro. It is a small, portable 40% keyboard that is as wide as the [11-inch iPad Pro](https://amzn.to/36ieveO) or the new [iPad Air 5](https://amzn.to/37J8jwF). Although the [Magic Keyboard](https://amzn.to/3NcJRUQ) is a great option for most people, it just isn't the same typing experience as a mechanical keyboard. If you still want a portable option with the great feel of customizable mechanical keys and switches, then the Planck or Preonic is your best bet!

The biggest difference is that traditional keyboards are laid out in a staggered fashion, while an ortholinear keyboard has all the keys in a straight row. This means that the user’s hands never have to leave the home row in order to type. However, it only takes a bit of time to get used to an ortholinear keyboard and even faster if you're a proficient touch typist. The OLKB Planck and Preonic are very similar keyboards with small differences outlined below and comes down to your preferences. Both are wired keyboards but use USB-C to connect. All you need is a USB-C to USB-C cable to get your keyboard working with your iPad!

### Planck
