## Why We Love the Planck Keyboard

There's plenty to love about OLKB's 40% [Planck keyboard](/olkb) . The build quality is the most consistent out of all orthos we've found and there are plenty of guides and documentation to help you with any troubleshooting issues. With QMK firmware and VIA support added in 2021, the Planck is easily customizable out of the box. And importantly, with all the inventory issues from the pandemic, it's the most available. You buy via Drop store on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/333pMu0) or directly on the [Drop](https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard?utm_source=linkshare&referer=T93XGG) website. Though certain colors come and go, other similar 40% ortholinear keyboard have been out of stock or even completely gone from the stores.

What's great is that there are still plenty of [keycaps](/keycaps) available for orthos like the Planck and below are a couple of our favorite combinations we've seen online!

### SA-P Snow Cap Keyset

<div class="col-lg-5">

We saw this setup on the Drop website and we loved the simplicity and how clean the [SA Snow Caps]() from PimpMyKeyboard looked with the white/grey theme. The single teal/green escape key is a good touch for a pop of color and they probably bought that single keycaps seperately from the keycap set. If you're interested in this keyset, click the link and below and make sure to choose either the text/icon modifiers and an alpha set that you want for your keyboard.

</div>
<div class="col-lg-5">

The MT3 keycap profile is based off the original IBM keyboards from the 1970s and we absolutely love it. We also found this on the Drop forums and love the wooden case and the [Drop MT3 White-on-Black](https://amzn.to/3BzUg69) keycaps. It looks like they're also using hte [Everglide Dark Jade Black Switches](https://amzn.to/35RJHAR).

The [YMDK Carbon](https://amzn.to/3DEKmCd) is a great budget keycap set that looks great on any setup. You can also get a set of blank keycaps via [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3DEKmCd) if that's your style and additional colors if you want to go for a black to white gradient or just pure white.

### Acute Keycaps

<div class="col-lg-5">

The [Acute keycaps](https://amzn.to/3rzSVKH) hold a special place in our heart since these were the standard OEM profile keycaps they could be bundled with Planck right when you buy it. The price is a pretty good for a starter keycap set and featured some sweet icon modifiers.

### Planck

The latest version of the Planck keyboard supports hot swappable switches, LEDs, a small speaker and even rotary encoders. There are several offerings for baseplates: EOTW (easy on the wallet), hi-pro and low-pro. These keyboards usually come in as a kit with some light assembly required.

### Preonic

The Preonic keyboard is the Planck's big brother with an extra row of keys for those really missing the number row or want more keys to customize. The newest version of the Preonic is almost identical the Planck in terms of features.
