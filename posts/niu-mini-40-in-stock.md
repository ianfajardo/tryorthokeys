# NIU Mini 40% Keyboard only in B-stock

THe [NIU Mini 40%](https://kbdfans.com/r?id=81km6r) is a popular orthlinear keyboard offered by KBDfans that has been out of stock for a while and has announced that the keyboard is back in stock on their site.  However, only B-stock is available, which from their website is defined as: "Brand new unused cases with only a few small scratches or dents".  

It is also good to note that the keyboard may not be coming back at all after this last B-stock drop.  In the restocking email sent to their waitlist they say, "Hi! we only have the B-stock now, and would not have plan to restock them, if  you want it, please check this link". Looking through the site navigation at KBDfans, the NIU Mini is noticeably absent from the 40% categories in both the DIY and fully assembled sections where they used to be. 

If you're interested in the keyboard this might be your last chance to pick it up.

### Planck

The latest version of the Planck keyboard supports hot swappable switches, LEDs, a small speaker and even rotary encoders. There are several offerings for baseplates: EOTW (easy on the wallet), hi-pro and low-pro. These keyboards usually come in as a kit with some light assembly required.
